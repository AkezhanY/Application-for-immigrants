0. Abstract
This project presents a responsive web application designed to support immigrants living in Płock, Poland. The platform provides essential services, including access to documents, employment information, healthcare services, and more. With an intuitive interface and multilingual support, the app serves as a one-stop resource for navigating various aspects of life in Poland. Users can quickly find answers to frequently asked questions, check legal status or seek assistance via AI and live chat.
1. Introduction and Motivation
Immigrants in Poland often face challenges in accessing crucial information related to legal matters, employment, healthcare, and social integration. This application aims to simplify these tasks and ensure immigrants can easily find relevant services. The project was motivated by the need for comprehensive, easily accessible information for newcomers, especially in an era of increasing immigration.
Main Questions:
●	How can immigrants in Poland better navigate the bureaucratic and social systems?

●	What services and information do immigrants need most when settling in a new country?

●	How can an AI-driven platform provide immediate support and guide users to relevant services?

2. Data Sources and Preparation
The project draws from a variety of official sources, including Polish government websites, city offices, and local services. Data sources such as phone numbers for emergency services, city departments, and immigrant centers are integrated directly into the app for easy access.
What kind of data was used?
 The project uses both numbers (quantitative)  and labels or categories  (qualitative). Here are the main types:
●	Quantitative Data: Includes phone numbers, working hours of city offices, required legal documents, and other numerical information.

●	Qualitative Data: Comprises the names of services, types of available support, and citizen categories (e.g., Ukrainian, Russian, etc.).

How was the data prepared?
●	The data is gathered from reliable local government sources and carefully integrated into the web application.

●	All information is structured to seamlessly support the functionality of the application, ensuring users can easily access relevant services and details.


3. Concept
Before implementing the final application, I planned the user interface and interaction flow using storyboards. These designs helped define the structure of the website and visualize how users would interact with the data.
  Storyboard
The storyboard illustrates a typical user journey through the application:
●	Landing on the main page with an introduction to the website and its purpose, offering easy access to essential resources for immigrants.

●	Navigating to the language selection, allowing users to choose their preferred language for a personalized experience and better comprehension of the content.

●	Viewing the profile section, where users can log in or manage their profile, providing access to personalized information and settings.

●	Accessing the knowledge base, where users can find detailed information on various topics like legalization of stay, healthcare, housing, employment, and more.

●	Exploring emergency contact information, offering quick access to important phone numbers and services such as local authorities, hospitals, and immigrant centers.

●	Utilizing the “First Steps” section, guiding users through a questionnaire that helps them receive personalized recommendations and directions tailored to their needs.

    Moodboard
The moodboard for the website is designed with a natural and warm color palette to evoke feelings of sustainability, energy, and growth. The key colors used are:
●	White (#FFFFFF): A clean, neutral background that keeps the layout bright, fresh, and easy to read. It ensures the content is easily accessible and promotes a minimalistic design.

●	Orange (#FF6B35): This vibrant shade adds energy and warmth, creating a dynamic contrast with the white background. It symbolizes innovation, movement, and a modern approach. It catches the eye while maintaining a sense of creativity and energy.

The combination of white and orange creates a balanced aesthetic that feels both fresh and grounded. These colors reflect the themes of sustainability, innovation, and a forward-thinking approach, making them ideal for a website focused on providing helpful resources and information.

 

This early planning allowed for better consistency and usability in the final design. It also helped identify potential layout issues and  adjust the interface before coding
4. Implementation
The website was built using basic web technologies:
●	HTML and CSS were used to create the layout and design. The website is responsive, ensuring it works seamlessly on various screen sizes and devices.

●	JavaScript adds interactivity, allowing users to interact with content and navigate between pages.

●	Netlify is the platform used to host the website, ensuring fast performance and easy management.

Connection
The pages were developed separately with unique content and functionality, then linked together using anchor tags (<a href="...">). For example, the "First Steps" page (pierwsze.html), "Knowledge Base" page (bazawiedzy.html), and "FAQ" page (kroki.html) are interconnected by their respective buttons, each leading to its specific page.
Once the pages were created, they were integrated using these links to form a coherent structure. The entire project was then connected in Visual Studio, allowing the different pages to be linked seamlessly and providing a smooth user experience.
Here’s an example from the code that links the pages:

<div class="buttons-container">
  <a href="pierwsze.html"><button class="main-button" id="surveyBtn" data-i18n="firstSteps">First Steps</button></a>
  <a href="bazawiedzy.html"><button class="main-button" id="firstStepsBtn" data-i18n="knowledgeBase">Knowledge Base</button></a>
  <a href="kroki.html"><button class="main-button" id="knowledgeBaseBtn" data-i18n="faq">FAQ</button></a>
</div>
